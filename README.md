## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Python's Tkinter library to create a simple yet functional GUI. It takes a distance input in miles and calculates the equivalent distance in kilometers using a fixed conversion factor. The application updates the result dynamically when the user clicks the "Calculate" button.

## How it Works

1. **Launch the App**: Run the `main.py` file.
2. **Input Miles**: Enter a numeric value representing miles.
3. **Convert**: Click the "Calculate" button.
4. **View Result**: The converted value in kilometers is displayed instantly on the screen.

**Conversion formula used**:
kilometers = miles × 1.60934

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Tkinter**: GUI toolkit for building desktop applications

## Lessons Learned

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Create and layout GUI components like `Label`, `Entry`, and `Button`
- Handle user input and update interface elements dynamically
- Use Tkinter’s `grid()` layout system effectively
- Perform basic unit conversion logic in response to events
